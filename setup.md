title: Setup
---

Please try to complete the following setup tasks ahead of the workshop. If you run into problems, we will have helpers on hand to help you at the start of the workshop.

## Create Docker Hub account

You should setup a free account on the Docker Hub ahead of the workshop:

- The [Docker Hub](http://hub.docker.com). We will use the Docker Hub to download pre-built container images, and for you to upload and download container images that you create, as explained in the relevant lesson episodes.

Please seek help at the start of the lesson if you have not been able to setup a Docker Hub account.

### Install the Docker software on your laptop

Please try to install the appropriate software from the list below depending on the operating system that your laptop is running:

- Microsoft Windows, either:
    - Try this first, although it won't work with Windows 10 Home Edition. Install the [Docker Desktop (Windows)](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows), or failing that;
    - Install the [Docker Toolbox (Windows)](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/).
- Apple macOS, either:
    - Try this first, although it will not work with older versions of macOS. Install the [Docker Desktop (Mac)](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac), or failing that:
    - Install the [Docker Toolbox (Mac)](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/).
- Linux: there are too many varieties of Linux to give precise instructions here, but hopefully you can locate documentation for getting Docker installed on your Linux distribution. It may already be installed. If it is not already installed on your system, see:
    - [Docker Engine on CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/)
    - [Docker Engine on Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)
    - [Docker Engine on Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/fedora/)
    - [Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
